            <p>
              Sooooooo, I started this project because I wanted to show off some of the skills I have that I do not always know how to articulate.  
              I was also let go from my last job at a weird time in my development as a programmer.  I was just getting to a point where I was 
              confident and comfortable with my skills and I was working on an awesome project that was really pushing me to learn more.  
              I had a mentor in a sense, someone I could ask questions to when I was stuck.  I really felt like I was getting traction and my boss 
              used me as a scapegoat for his own inabilities and I was let go.  It really sucked because I was getting better at what I was doing 
              but it really affected my confidence.  Not only that but I really didn't know what direction I was heading with my career at the time.  
              So I did what I always do, continued taking classes online to learn more and build my confidence back up. The classes were a great help 
              so I decided I needed a project to show off the skills.  I had just missed a job opportunity because I did not know enough django.  
              So why not work with django some more.  I had a taste of it so let's continue building on that.  It was perfect, I could follow some tutorials 
              to get started and then build from there.  Not only that but I would be challenged in many different areas, python, web, web hosting, ssl, domains, 
              the cloud, and git.  I had some experience in all of them but I have never had to bring them all together on my own.  
                  
              I will continue to post and add updates to the project as I go but I figure this will atleast give you an idea of what you are 
              looking at here.  Thank you and hope you come back to see how it goes.

          <img class="aboutme-image" style="height:200px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="{% static 'media/django-gettingstarted.jpg' %}">
          <p>I am a mid-level programmer in my 30's that has returned to the tech world in the last couple years. 
              I had previously spent some time in the industry as well as spending my free time online 
              learning. I do a lot of online learning, it fills the time and keeps me fresh on what I am doing.
              my main focus has been working in python and learning more dev ops but I also have a history with 
              web development.  web is really where I got my start.
